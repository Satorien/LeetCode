## Initial Solution
### Notes
- Use `set` to know when previously shown node appears again
  - `head` itself must match the existing node in `node set`
  - `head.val` wouldn't be enough to know if it is exactly the same node  
- Consider when the list reaches an end
```Python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        node_set = set()
        
        while True:
            if not head:
                return False
            elif head in node_set:
                return True
            else:
                node_set.add(head)
                head = head.next
```
