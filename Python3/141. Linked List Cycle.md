## Initial Solution
### Notes
- Use `set` to know when previously shown node appears again
  - `head` itself must match the existing node in `node set`
  - `head.val` wouldn't be enough to know if it is exactly the same node  
- Consider when the list reaches an end

```Python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        node_set = set()
        
        while True:
            if not head:
                return False
            elif head in node_set:
                return True
            else:
                node_set.add(head)
                head = head.next
```
### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Alternatives
### Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
- Famous algorithm to keep in mind
  - Reduce memory usage by 0.5MB and time by 3ms
    - `set` takes up memory, but slow and fast requires only 2 variables
    - `in` operator is slower
- Using `!=` in lieu of `is not` results in 3ms reduction
```Python3
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if not head:
            return False
        else:
            fast = head.next

        while head is not fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            else:
                head = head.next
                fast = fast.next.next
        return True
```
- Changing the order of the logic in while loop
  - The code is simple and concise in this way
```Python3
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            head = head.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if head is fast:
                return True
    
        return False
```
